					<p> For the first time in human history, more people live in cities. Historically, cities were designed around trade routes, access to food sources and access to hubs of commerce. As technological advances alter societal constructs and revolutionize logistics, these constraints are losing significance. With economic opportunity and the convenience of city dwelling leading to a disproportionate influx of inhabitants, the finite resources of cities will continue to be strained.<br><br> Here, we believe the role of technology in urban planning, organization, facilitation and inhabitation will integral to the citizen experience which we believe will be increasingly important as cities will compete to attract, excite and retain the most innovative talent globally. <br>

					We believe that every city is at a separate stage in its lifecycle, and requires a unique, technologically-tailored solution to solve its problems. The disparities between developed countries and developing economies will reduce as technology enables rapid development with quantifiable impact. We believe cities will morph rapidly to develop unique identities.
