					<h2>Products, projects & processes for the cities of tomorrow.</h2>

					<p> For the first time in human history, more people live in cities. Historically cities were designed around trade routes, access to food sources and access to hubs of commerce. As technological advances alter societal constructs and revolutionize logistics, these constraints no longer apply. With economic opportunity and the convenience of city dwelling leading leading to a disproportionate influx of inhabitants, the finite resources of cities will continue to be strained.<br><br> Here, we believe the role of technology in urban planning, organization, facilitation and inhabitation will integral to the citizen experience which we believe will be increasingly important as cities will compete to attract, excite and retain the most innovative talent globally. <br>

					The disparities between developed countries and developing economies will reduce as technology enables rapid development with quantifiable impact. We believe cities will morph to develop unique identities. <br>

					Currently, in developing countries the focus is on building infrastructure, increasing security, improve planning, solidify manufacturing and emphasize social enterprise.

					Developed countries are more focused on organization, content creation, privacy and curation <br><br>
