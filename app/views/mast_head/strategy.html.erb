					<h2>Futureproofing with digital, data & perspective.</h2>

					<p> The foundation for the future is being forged by the rise of the age of information. Big data, mobile technology, wearable technology, social networks, urbanization, the divergence of the internet into anonymous and public connectivity are all current and emerging factors which will continue to shape how we live, work and communicate. Most organizations are engaged in a technology-led transformation exercise, to retain relevance and to cope with the ongoing metamorphosis which will impact their business in multiple, unprecedented ways. Amidst such volatility, digital has proven to be the methodology of choice to spearhead transitions as it is cheaper, quicker, more reliable and capable of revealing revelatory connections between abstract components. From revamping corporate and brand communication efforts to organizing crowds for collaborate objective achievement, we use strategy borne of perspective and analysis to conceptualize, design and implement plans of varying magnitude, which manage existing scenarios, shape future products, develop markets, attract and retain customers, and augment omni-directional, interactive communication efforts </p>

					<p> There is yet another shift underway; commoditization. The first televisions, cell phones, cars, networks, websites were all exorbitantly priced. Fifteen years ago, a website used to cost thousands of dollars. Today an elegant website can be had for less than $10/month. Famously, all cellphones prior to 2007 used to look identical. All cellphones post 2007 also look identical, yet nothing like their earlier counterparts. Apple opened the floodgates for third-party developers with it's pioneering App Store, Today, everyone from Facebook to Shopify has an app store. The importance of innovation becomes even more apparent at this stage since that remains the only true differentiating factor and sustainable competitive advantage. Yet innovation itself is a byproduct of strategy. How will organizations cope without an innovation roadmap when growth stagnates or markets saturate? </p>

					<p> Ubiquity of evolving internet technology, rapid proliferation of increasingly intelligent, data-capable mobile devices, commoditization of accessibility, and an exponential increase in application usage have led to an abnormal increase in data point generation. Big Data is a very real phenomenon which attempts to gain, clean, organize, analyze all data to convert it into actionable knowledge efficiently, effectively and economically. The advantages include better prediction, evaluation and organization models which can help us plan, implement, conserve and manage everything from new product development to controlling epidemics. Yet most organizations don't have adequate data collection mechanisms in place. If the datasets are not being developed, they cannot be queried to reveal strategic insights. In such an instance, how can companies harness big data to gain, excel, diversify and grow? </p>

					<p> Our engagements range from short-term spectrum audits to multi-year arrangements. In addition to hourly billing, as is standard in the consulting industry, we are big fans of <%= link_to "value pricing", "http://www.ignitiongroup.com/consulting/agency-compensation/", :target => "_blank" %> which we believe will ultimately become the standard when the consulting industry eventually gets <%= link_to "disrupted", "http://hbr.org/2013/10/consulting-on-the-cusp-of-disruption/ar/1", :target => "_blank" %>. </p>
